There is usually not enough time for this. Basics of Xtext (AST, parse-link-validate-generate-cycle) should be clear

Explain role of Xbase for Xtend and what Xtend adds to Xbase (class-related concepts, RichStrings etc.)

Demonstrate using Observable-example from xtend-annotations-example[-client] project.
It is distributed with Xtend (New > Example... > Xtend Active Annotation Example).
